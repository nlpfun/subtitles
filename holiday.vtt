00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.930
China is stirring the pot with a controversial national holiday this year.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.610
It's called Victory Day of the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.970
And it marks 70 years since China claimed victory over the Japanese.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.850
In a one-off occasion, Chinese are marking September 3rd with a military parade and a day off.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.210
Such spontaneous holidays are very rare here.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.850
But the announcement is worrying Japanese businesses and members of the Japanese community here

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.500
who have been dealing with violent anti-Japan protest in recent years.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.090
Japanese car makers have taken the biggest hit as images of protesters smashing those cars have gone viral in the past.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.100
Japanese auto makers don't think it's likely there will be big protests again.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.050
But if consumers are still concerned about their own cars being a target of such violence

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.330
that could make Chinese think twice about buying.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.730
The relationship between China and Japan is rockier than ever.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.500
The nations are locked in a conflict over island chain in the East China Sea.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.570
And Shinzo Abe's military ambitions are not helping things.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.870
Tensions have been on the simmer for years.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.320
Sometimes boiling over into massive anti-Japan protests,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.800
like the ones that swept through Shanghai in 2005, badly damaging the Japanese consulate.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.370
But it's not all about keeping an old enemy on its toes.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.250
Critics say the anniversary is also a way to shift the focus away from problems at home, like corruption in the government.
